value. If the status is true, then strike through the text and when

delete customization where if the checkbox is checked you need to show the 
delete button for each todo and if not checked delete buttons should not 
be shown beside each todo. And there should be a three-colour choice for 
each todo suppose from three if the user selects red, the background of that 
todo must be turned to red
